# Algorithmic-Problems
It contains fundamental algorithmic problems in Java.
I borrowed these problems from leetcode (https://leetcode.com/) and geeksforgeeks (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and solve them by myself. 
Based on my experience in software engineering, a computer scientist should always refresh and review fundamentals in data structure and algorithms.
